##about

This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a **Computer Science** course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we gave preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) type of courses because those courses were created with our style of learning in mind.
